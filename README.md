## Problem Description

Robby is a self-directed robot tasked to pick up cans, which are randomly littered around a MÃ—N board. Every grid of the board has one can at most. Also, every side of the board is wall that Robby can not move beyond the board.

However, robot Robby is not clever and capable enough with his limited perception over 5 surrounding grid world - north, south, west, east and his original spot. He has 7 different behaviors which are collect trash, move north, south, west, east, stay in the grid and a random move respectively.

Our aim is to find out the best strategy for Robby to collect the most numerous cans in the limited movements via Genetic Algorithms. Broadly speaking, Robby first percept the status of his surroundings then make movements according to his genes.
